        <h3>Project Brief</h3>
        <p>WhatsApp gives features for free texting, voice call and video call. 
            Since it is a widely popular and used application, there are both some eye-catching features and some frustrations. 
            The frustration which user face while using WhatsApp is the auto-download of the media, privacy while connecting 
            with someone, a limited number of media sharing at a time, and group chat adding feature...etc. 
            As a result, in our design, we use the idea that some are included in WhatsApp like chat, calls, story, account settings, 
            camera and group chat to minimize the frustration and problems we collect from the survey, 
            new features and solutions will be needed.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>WhatsApp is a messaging app designed for both mobile and web platforms. 
            We decided to focus on the mobile platform because it is much more common, 
            and features could be focused more easily onto it.</li>
          <li>We designed our survey questions together, and a total of 20 people responded to them. 
            Our survey questions were different from the interview questions. A total of 4 people were interviewed. 
            After analyzing the data from the survey and interviews, we discussed the major features and flaws of WhatsApp. 
            The team all sketched their own versions of the app, and when they were all finished, we discussed what to keep from 
            each sketch for improvement. Once everything was complete, we reviewed everything together 
            to finalize and polish our ideas.</li>
          <li>We use a monochrome colour scheme to maintain consistency.</li>
          <li>There are mainly 6 features on the WhatsApp app, which include: login and sign-up page, 
            chat page, creating group chat, contact page, add new friend page, story page, settings page.  </li>
